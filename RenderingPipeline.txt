When DrawTriangles is called,
1. Vertex Shader is called for every vertex passed
2. For each triangle (formed from indices), triangles is tested if need to completly clipped or culled
3. Each triangle (that is not culled or clipped) is now rasterized
4. During rasterization, edges are formed and scan filling is used to find pixels to plot
5. As we scan, vertex attributes and depth are interpolated as well
6. Finally Fragment Shader is called with a parameter "point", which contains pixel (x,y) position, depth and attributes
Note:
Vertex Shader is called for each vertex and returns:
- position in NDC (homogeneous coordinates) of the vertex
- varying attributes that need to be interpolated during rasterization
Fragment is called for each pixel and gets
- pixel position
- depth
- interpolated attributes
and is responsible to calculate color for that pixel (illumination and stuffs) and plot at given point with calculated color
